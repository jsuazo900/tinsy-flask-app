Now What?

Now that you have finsihed the hands-on activity, you have a few options. If
you would like to investigate Python and Flask further take a look at the
[Flask Quickstart Guide](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/)

**Suggested TODO:**

1. Skim the quickstart.
2. Add another page (``localhost:$MYPORT/mypage`` for example).
3. Display a randomly chosen message from a list each time the user loads the
   page.
4. Link to the new page from your original page.

If you're less than confident in your Python skills, check out the [The Python
2.7 Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html)
